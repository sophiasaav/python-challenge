# Python-Challenge
In this exercise I analyze bank and election data utilizing python.

### PyBank

The data used for this portion of the challenge consists of a .csv file containing dates and their corresponding profits or losses.
With this I determined the net profit, average change, as well as the greatest increases and decreases in profits and exported the results to a .txt file.

Below are the libraries and dependencies I utilized.

Below is the code used to calculate the differences in profits/losses from month to month.

### PyPoll

The polling data provided consisted of a .csv file with the ballot ID number, County and candidate information for each ballot cast.
I used this data to calculate the percentage of votes each candidate recieved and to determine the winner of the election. The results were exported to a .txt file.

Below is the code used to calculate the percentages of votes each candidate recieved and the overall winner of the election.

### Conclusions
I found that during the month of August 2016 the bank had its greatest increase in profits, and that in February 2014 the bank had ist greatest decrease in profits.

Regarding the election data, I inferred that Diana Degette won with 73% of the popular vote.

### Opportunities for Future Exploration
One could further analyze the banking data provided by determining whether or not certain months are correlated with decreases in profits.
